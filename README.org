* rich-minority-mode

Emacs package for hiding and/or highlighting the list of minor-modes
in the mode-line.

** Usage

To activate the enrichment of your minor-modes list, call =M-x rich-minority-mode=, or add this to your init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(rich-minority-mode)
#+end_src

By default, this has a couple of small effects (provided as examples)
it is up to you to customize it to your liking with the following
three variables:

- rm-blacklist :: List of minor mode names that will be hidden
     from the minor-modes list. Use this to hide *only* a few modes that
     are always active and don't really contribute information.
- rm-whitelist :: List of minor mode names that are allowed on
     the minor-modes list. Use this to hide *all but* a few modes.
- rm-text-properties :: List text properties to apply to each
     minor-mode lighter. For instance, by default we highlight =Ovwrt=
     with a red face, so you always know if you're in =overwrite-mode=.

** Comparison to Diminish
Diminish is an established player in the mode-line world, who also
handles the minor-modes list. What can rich-minority /offer in contrast/?

- rich-minority is more versatile:
  1. It accepts *regexps*, instead of having to specify each minor-mode individually;
  2. It also offers a *whitelist* behaviour, in addition to the blacklist;
  3. It supports *highlighting* specific minor-modes with completely arbitrary text properties.
- rich-minority takes a cleaner, functional approach. It doesn't hack
  into the =minor-mode-alist= variable.

What is rich-minority /missing/?

1. It doesn't have a quick and simple replacement functionality yet.
   Though, technically, you can set the =display= text property of a
   minor-mode to whatever string you want and that will function as a
   replacement.
2. Its source comments lack [[http://www.eskimo.com/~seldon/diminish.el][Will Mengarini's poetry]]. :-)
** Installation

This package is available fom Melpa, you may install it by calling
=M-x package-install=.

Alternatively, you can download it manually, place it in your
=load-path= and require it with

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'rich-minority)
#+end_src
